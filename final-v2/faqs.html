    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h2>
      <p>The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but would not be able to land. The Falcon Heavy can throw about 16,000 kilograms (when configured to be expendable) on a trans-lunar injection orbit, so it can send a Dragon 2 capsule to the moon with quite a lot of margin. However, in order to land on a surface you need to slow down from orbital velocity, which requires you to change your velocity by a certain amount (called ∆V). Dragon 2 carries only a small amount of propellant and can only deliver a small amount of ∆V. The exact amount is less than 500m/s, which doesn't come close to the ~1870 m/s needed to land on the moon. It may be possible to do it with two FH launches but that would require additional technology development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is Red Dragon?</h2>
      <p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martian surface. The mission would be an unmanned scientific lander, and the heaviest object ever to be placed on Mars. There have been no official announcements about the mission from SpaceX, and there is no indication that the project will be funded.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h2>
      <p>No. Dragon is too cramped, and would need significant improvements in the life support system to last throughout the long journey. Elon Musk himself has stated that Dragon 2 can support seven astronauts for "several days".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why does the Dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</h2>
      <p>The current version of Dragon physically cannot dock, and can only berth. This is because it has a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port, and not a NASA Docking System (NDS) port. The advantage of the CBM is that it's 50 inches (1270 mm) in diameter, whereas the NDS is only 800 mm (31.5 inches) wide. The disadvantage of berthing is that it's a tedious process whereby astronauts carefully maneuver the capsule into place using Canadarm, and then physically bolt the CBM ports together. To unberth, the reverse must occur. Docking, by contrast, is autonomous and much faster in both directions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h2>
      <p>The Dragon 1 would make a very poor lifeboat for the ISS. The CRS Dragon does not dock, instead it "berths" to the ISS. Berthing is a slow and tedious process, far too slow for a quick escape. There are two Soyuzes attached to the station that are always ready to go at a moment's notice, so it's difficult to imagine a scenario where Dragon would be used as an escape pod.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h2>
      <p>No. Dragon does not carry enough fuel to reboost the station. The SuperDraco engines are too powerful, and the docking ports are incapable of handling the force. The current solutions for reboosting the ISS are simpler and more effective.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h2>
      <p>The Dragon 2 has a total delta-v of 420 m/s, according to Hans Koenigsmann. The capsule weighs 21,000 lbs (9525 kg), with 3500 lbs (1588 kg) of that being propellant.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters were to fail during landing?</h2>
      <p>Dragon 2 can lose up to two of its eight SuperDraco thrusters without any problems. If a failure occurs, parachutes would be deployed, and the craft would splash down in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</h2>
      <p>No, SuperDraco and Draco engines serve different purposes. SuperDracos are much more powerful and are used for launch escape, while Draco engines are used for in-orbit maneuvers and adjustments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is PICA-X? Does PICA-X ablate?</h2>
      <p>PICA-X (Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator) is a material used as a heat shield. It ablates in the extreme heat of reentry, which helps protect the capsule. SpaceX improved on the material to make it cheaper and more reusable, allowing for more uses in missions like Dragon 2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h2>
      <p>Technically, yes, but economically it isn't feasible. It's cheaper to build a new telescope than to modify Dragon 2 for servicing. The hardware needed would be expensive, and Hubble's technology is outdated compared to modern telescopes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why does Dragon's trunk stay attached during an abort scenario?</h2>
      <p>The trunk helps prevent the Dragon capsule from flipping during a launch abort. Its large surface area helps stabilize the capsule until it can be separated safely in the event of an emergency.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</h2>
      <p>The Dragon reentry process involves deorbit burns, jettisoning the trunk, and deploying parachutes. The capsule is then slowed to a safe speed for splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
