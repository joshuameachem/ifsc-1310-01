   <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility: </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Web accessibility means that everyone can access information and services on the web no matter if they have a disability or anything else that may prevent a user from viewing information on the web. </li>
    <li>Web accessibility is making sure that your web page follows all the laws put in place by a country that requires a web page to be accessible for all users to avoid any legal issues or fines.</li>
    <li>By making a website accessible it can reach more people, which increases user engagement on that website.</li>
    <li>Accessible websites make sure that websites can remain usable and up-to-date over time.</li>
  </ul>
